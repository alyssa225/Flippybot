Overall, you did this assignment well and its clear to me that you put a lot of work in and have come a long way from HW 1!

Style comments:
extra files (.urdf and .sdf) are left in base directory) 
__pycache__ is in the test directory but should not be in git 

GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH is for gazebo classic and should not be in launch file
There are simpler ways of comparing things in launchfiles than PythonExpression, (such as LaunchConfigurationEquals) but that works!
PythonLaunchDescription is not necessary, IncludeLaunchDescription works with python launch files

2. Package does not properly setup gazebo asset paths
