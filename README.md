##Quickstart
1. Use `ros2 launch diff_drive ddrive.launch.py` to launch the robot in gazebo and see the corresponding model view in rviz.
2. To just run rviz use `ros2 launch diff_drive ddrive_rviz.launch.py`
3. There is configuration `view_only` that launches gui joint state publisher in rviz. Used as `view_only:=True`

I worked with Vaish, Liz, Kate, and Hang
